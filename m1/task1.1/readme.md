# Lab # 1 report

## Doing this lab I've got such skills in git:
  1) how to create private git repo via GitHub
  2) how to clone it to local folder
  3) how to create and work in differetn branches
  4) how to add collaborators to my GitHub repo
  5) also I've faced such problem as merge conflict:
      * the problem occurred because of changes in same line of file
        in different branches
      * so I've used "git mergetool" where program showed me problematic
        lines and I fixed it
  6) Besides this, I've got info about all commits and merges using "git log"
